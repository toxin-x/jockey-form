    <h2>Hello! We are creating a bot to replay Dischead Jockeys sets 24/7 and we would like you to be a part of it! The next page will be a form to fill out the info and tracklist. Simply fill out all the info, download the file, and send said file to AJ. If you have any questions like when your set was, please contact AJ. </h2>
    <h4>Style Guide:</h4>
    <p>If you play multiple songs at once, please put them as two separate tracks with "/w" at the start of the second track, and if they start at the same time, add an extra second to the second track so they are announced in the right order. </p> 
    <p>IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DELETE TRACKS FROM WITHIN THE FORM, however you can manually edit all the info by downloading and editing the file.</p>
