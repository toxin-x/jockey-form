    <h2>Hello! This page is to create a tracklist the bots can read out while your set is playing! This will work for both during your Dischead Jockeys night and for Dischead Jockeys Radio. The next page will be a form to fill out the info and tracklist. Simply fill out all the info, download the file, and send said file to AJ. If you have any questions please contact AJ.
    </h2>
    <h4>Style Guide:</h4>
    <p>If you play multiple songs at once, please put them as 2 separate tracks with "w/" at the start of the artist in the 2nd track, and if they start at the same time, add an extra second to the 2nd track so they are announced in the right order. </p> 
    <p>IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MOVE OR DELETE TRACKS FROM WITHIN THE FORM because I coded this like an idiot, however you can manually edit all the info once downloaded.</p>
